#Abstract
This study works on a dataset which includes information of the Hollywood movies of the year
2011 and focuses on some of the variables which affect a movie's success. More specifically, 
the purpose of the analysis is to build a multiple linear regression model that helps to explain if the variables such 
as budget, genre and the opening weekend gross of the movie have any influence on the box office success of the movie. 

#Purpose:
the main goal of the study is to test the relationship between these three independent variables and dependent/response 
variable, which is world gross collection, and then to build a multiple linear regression model 
which explains the influence of the independent variables on the response variable.
